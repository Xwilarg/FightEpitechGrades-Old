Hi, welcome on this little tutorial about how to make an AI.

You MUST write your code un ai_new.cpp
For beginning, please write your code after the following line :
Ai ai(me, enemy, xWin, yWin, canFire);
and please stay in the brackets.
Please make not we won't allow your AI if it can do more than 1 action in one function call (see bellow)

You can find explanations about all the functions in ai.hpp

There are 2 kind of commands:

* The instruction:
ai.instruction();

You can replace 'instruction' by the instruction you want to give to your AI.
ai.jump();
ai.fireRed();
Etc...


* The condition:

if (ai.function() == 1)
{
  // Then to that
}
else if (ai.function() == 2)
{
  // Then do that
}
else
{
  // Then do that
}

You can replace function by the function you want to call.
Your AI can must not do more than 1 instruction by function call. An instruction is something that will affect your AI in game.

if (ai.getLifeMe() < 50)
{
  if (ai.getYPosAiDown() <= getYSizeScreen / 2 && ai.getLifeMe() < 25)
  {
    ai.fall();
  }
  else
  {
    ai.jump();
  }
}
else
{
  ai.moveLeft();
}

This code was correct because the AI can only do one instruction before lefting the function.
Comparaisons operator:
==    is equal to
!=    is different to
<     is inferior to
<=    is inferior or equal to
>     is superior to
>=    is superior or equal to
More than one conditions in a if:
&&    and
||    or

Once you will have finish your AI, you can write 'make re' in the console to compill, then you can execute the program.


COMPILATION ERRORS:
This part cover errors who happen the more often.
Correcting an error can sometimes solve the ones who follow.
Please also check that you didn't write something stupid.

error: expected ';' before 'else'
---> Check if you didn't forget a semicolon

error: 'jump" was not declared in this scope
---> Check if you didn't forget to write 'ai.' before your function name

error: invalid use of non-static member function
---> check if you didn't forget to write the 2 parenthesis aften your function name

error: no matching function for call to 'Ai::randomNumber()'
---> some functions take a number in parameter, please check ai.hpp to see what they need, this error can also happen if you didn't write the fuction name's correcly.

error: lvalue required as left operand of assignment
---> you need to write 2 equals '==' to compare 2 values

error: expected ')' before '{' token
---> count your parenthesis, you must have as much as opening than closing parenthesis

error: expected primary-expression before ')' token
---> count your parenthesis, you must have as much as opening than closing parenthesis

warning: suggest parentheses around '&&' within '||'
---> the compilator suggest you to use parenthesis to clarify which instruction set of instructions will be done first
